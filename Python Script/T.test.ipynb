    "\n",

    "2. **Column Initialization:**\n",

    "-A new column, 'Good Consultant2', is added to the DataFrame to store the results of the statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative T-Test:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-For each company, the script extracts the data on departures and hires.\n",
    "-A T-test (ttest_ind) is performed to compare these two datasets.\n",
    "-The p-value is used to determine if there's a significant difference between departures and hires (with a significance level of 2.5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Assignment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-Based on the p-value, the 'Good Consultant2' column is updated with either 'Departures =! Hires' (indicating a significant difference) or 'Departures = Hires' (no significant difference).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Display: **\n",
    "\n",
    "-The DataFrame, with the new column showing the test results for each company, is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of the Analysis:\n",
    "This method provides insights into whether consulting firms have a balanced talent flow (similar numbers of departures and hires) or if there are significant disparities.\n",
    "The statistical approach ensures that observed differences are not due to random chance, adding rigor to the analysis.\n",
    "Such insights can inform strategic decisions in talent management, helping companies understand if they are losing more talent than they are gaining or vice versa."
